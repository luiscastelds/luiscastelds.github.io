Born and raised in **El Salvador**, I'm currently a **Purdue University student** with a strong passion for **mathematics, data science, and technology**. My focus is on developing models that explore the complexities of statistics and uncover the true patterns hidden behind numbers. I thrive on solving complex problems and digging into their root causes, always seeking creative solutions.

Driven by my love for numbers and tech, I'm excited about the endless possibilities these fields offer. I strongly believe in building something meaningful and am fully committed to ensuring that creativity never gets restricted by limitations.

Although I'm just beginning my career, I'm always open to new **learning opportunities, collaborations, and connections** that allow me to grow.

Outside of academics, my **creativity and problem-solving** are fueled by my hobbies — **tech tinkering, grilling, and classical music**.
