Born and raised in **El Salvador**, I'm a **Purdue University Alumn** with a strong passion for **mathematics, data science, and technology**. My focus is on developing something original and meaningful. I know it sounds very cliche and it probably is but what is the point of building or working on something you are not proud of or you did not commit your best efforts in. Always be proud of your contributions and do not hesitate to try new things even though they might not be the trendiest!

Outside of academics, my **creativity and problem-solving** are fueled by my hobbies — **pc building, grilling, and classical music**.
