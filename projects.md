## Java Marketplace Program
**Stack:** Java, OOP, Swing, Serializable  
**What I did:** 
- Group project where I developed most (if not all) of the backend for a marketplace applicationâ€”object models.
- Added all of the methods to buy, sort, sell items, etc, etc

**Comments:**
- This was a final project for a class
- I always felt that writing to a file is dull, decided to go with serializable.
- Using serializable was fun but added a bigger challenge for my lack of experience.
- That's why you can see the weird looking for loops in the [repository](https://github.com/titerms/final-project-5) (was on my old github account, titerms)

## Homelab Server Deployment
**Stack:** Linux, CasaOS, Networking  
**What I did:**
- Built a personal homelab on Ubuntu Server to self-host files and media.
- Deployed [CasaOS](https://casaos.zimaspace.com/) apps ( Plex, game servers, monitoring dashboards, ollama).
- Set up secure remote access via Tailscale (SSH), and organized basic network/service monitoring.

**Comments:**
- Scraping computer parts to build a homelab server is really fun.
- Learned that there are tons of amazing apps easy to setup in CasaOS.
- I wanted to build a home media server because we have tons of movies laying around and I don't want to pay for cloud.
- The project died very early because I need to learn how to portforward properly otherwise it felt like a major security flaw.

## Carcassonne Markov Chain Model
**Stack:** Python, NumPy, Stochastic Processes  
**What I did:**
- Analyzed [Carcassonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)) with a markov chain.
- Broke down the game to find a possible strategy or something.

**Comments:**
- Final Project for Stochastic Processes class (MA432)
- Probably the most complex project I've been a part of.
- The project was so complex because Carcassonne is a terrible game to analyze with markov chains.
- We still picked Carcassonne because we are huge fans of the game.
- We had to break down the game so much it no longer was carcassonne.
- Here you can check out our results, [presentation]({% link /assets/files/carcassonneProject.pdf %}).

## Personal Website
**Stack:** Jekyll, GitHub Pages  
**What I did:**
- Well you are looking at it!

**Comments:**
- This was an easy project to do and maintain.
- Originally wanted a website to host my academic coursework because I wanted easy access to my notes.
- Decided it would be best to create my personal website with a 'MyNotes' section.
- Check regularly, I will add tons of cool stuff with time!
