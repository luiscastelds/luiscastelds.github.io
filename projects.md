## Java Marketplace Program
**Stack:** Java, OOP, Swing, Serializable  
**What I did:** 
- Group project where I developed most of the backend for a marketplace application, similar to ebay.
- One of the problems we had was reading and updating files.
- I proposed a solution to use serializable and modify objects instead.
- Created all of the logic methods such as, buy, sell, list, search, addProduct, etc
- Also created all of the classes for what I described above, product, seller, customer, marketplace, market, store.
  
**Comments:**
- This was a final project for a class (CS180).
- I always felt that writing to a file is dull, added value and rigor to the project by implementing serializable.
- Using serializable was fun but added a bigger challenge for my lack of experience.
- Although serializable was a huge challenge in the beginning at the end it was a massive success because we avoided editing and writing text files for everything.
- That's why you can see the weird looking for loops in the [repository](https://github.com/titerms/final-project-5) (was on my old github account, titerms).

## Homelab Server Deployment
**Stack:** Linux, CasaOS, Networking  
**What I did:**
- Built a personal homelab with Ubuntu Server to self-host files and media.
- Deployed [CasaOS](https://casaos.zimaspace.com/) apps.
- Hosted my own DVD, CD, and Bluray copies of media and streamed them with plex.
- Used ollama to run LLM with my own hardware.
- Set up a minecraft server with Crafty.
- Set up secure remote access via Tailscale (SSH).

**Comments:**
- Scraping computer parts to build a homelab server is really fun.
- Hosting your own files and media tastes like freedom.
- Learned that there are tons of amazing apps easy to setup in CasaOS.
- I wanted to build a home media server because we have tons of movies laying around and I don't want to pay for cloud.
- Gave a new life to old DVDs, CDs, and Blurays and saved money by hosting my own files instead of paying for services such as Drive or Dropbox.
- The project died very early because I need to learn how to portforward properly otherwise it felt like a major security flaw.

## [Carcassonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)) Markov Chain Model
**Stack:** Python, NumPy, Stochastic Processes  
**What I did:**
- Broke down the game to eliminate concerns.
- Developed a new scoring and tile placement system.
- Simplified the state space and transition probabililties.
- Analyzed the "new" game and the advantages a player may get based on turns.

**Comments:**
- Final Project for Stochastic Processes class (MA432).
- Probably the most complex project I've been a part of.
- The project was so complex because Carcassonne is a terrible game to analyze with markov chains.
- We still picked Carcassonne because we are huge fans of the game and we wanted to learn how to modify some real world problem to get a Markov chain to analyze.
- We had to break down the game so much it no longer was Carcassonne.
- Here you can check out our [results]({% link assets/files/carcassonneProject.pdf %})

## Personal Website
**Stack:** Jekyll, GitHub Pages  
**What I did:**
- Well you are looking at it!

**Comments:**
- This was an easy project to do and maintain.
- Originally wanted a website to host my academic coursework because I wanted easy access to my notes.
- Not only easy access but free cloud, so thansk github-pages.
- Decided it would be best to create my personal website with a 'MyNotes' section.
- Check regularly, I will add tons of cool stuff with time!
