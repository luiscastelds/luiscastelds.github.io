## Homelab Server Deployment
**Stack:** Linux, CasaOS, Networking  
**What I did:**
- Built a personal homelab on Ubuntu Server to self-host files and media.
- Deployed CasaOS apps ( Plex, game servers, monitoring dashboards, ollama).
- Set up secure remote access via Tailscale (SSH), and organized basic network/service monitoring.

**Comments:**
- Scraping computer parts to build a homelab server is really fun.
- Learned that there are tons of amazing apps easy to setup in CasaOS.
- I wanted to build a home media server because we have tons of movies laying around and I don't want to pay for cloud.
- The project died very early because I need to learn how to portforward properly otherwise it felt like a major security flaw.

- Check regularly, I will add tons of cool stuff with time!
